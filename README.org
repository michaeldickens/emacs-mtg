This module allows you to define MTG cards in Org Mode using a new type of link prefixed with ~mtg:~. For example:

~[[mtg:Black Lotus]]~

When Org Mode sees a link to an MTG card, it will do the following:

1. If the card is not downloaded yet, download the card by querying the [[https://scryfall.com/][Scryfall]] API for a card with the given name.
2. When you open the link (using ~org-open-at-point~ or ~C-c C-o~), Emacs displays an image of the card in the minibuffer.
